# SmithWatermanRaspi
This is the repo for my project(Smith Waterman on a Raspberry Pi) in my lab for Bioinformatics and Genomics.

I will try to create a Smith Waterman Machine on a raspberry pi 3. If succesful I will try to create a small cluster of 
raspberry pi's to do the same thing but faster.
