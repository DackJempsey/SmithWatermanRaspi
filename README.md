# SmithWatermanRaspi
This is the repo for my project(Smith Waterman on a Raspberry Pi) in my lab for Bioinformatics and Genomics.

I will try to create a Smith Waterman Machine on a raspberry pi 3. If succesful I will try to create a small cluster of 
raspberry pi's to do the same thing but faster.

# Programs
There are two main programs to this project. An Encoding Scheme(SWEncode.c) and the Algorithm(SWAlgo.c). They are found in the src file. In the Test Files directory are the varous size DNA files which I used to test the algorithm. In the outputs directory there are the sample outputs from the SWAEncoding algorithm.
