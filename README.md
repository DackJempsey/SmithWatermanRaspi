# SmithWatermanRaspi
This is the repo for my project(Smith Waterman on a Raspberry Pi) in my lab for Bioinformatics and Genomics.

I will try to create a Smith Waterman Machine on a raspberry pi 3. If succesful I will try to create a small cluster of 
raspberry pi's to do the same thing but faster.

In this folder we have the Notes file which has my daily notes. There is also the TODO file which is updated ~weekly.
