I have downlaoded the raspberrypi/linux repo on my computer to look at the linux kernel that runs on the raspi so that I can understand the kernel better.

Now I am working on the encoding part of the project.
After looking at various schemes I am gong to continue with a 3 bit encoding, two encoding bits with a check bit. 
It can only detect and not correct errors, so then the bit will have to be resent.
Some troubles I have ran into is that integers in c are encoded in bytes, and I cannot go from char -> int becuase it does not compress the data as much as id like. 

I am also using geany as a code editor.

After thinking about it for a little bit (haha) I think that I would like to use a 4 bit encoding scheme.
Then I could store two nucleotides as a byte.
Use repetition as a check, not fancy but simple. Also can translate to hex easily

a= 0000 = 0
t= 0101 = 5
c= 1010 = A
g= 1111 = F

 
On second thinking, I will go back to the 2 bit encoding scheme.
Then 4 characters will be translated to one character. 
Then send character at a time to the cpu to align, then send to memory to add to bigger matirix.

a= 00 
t= 01 
c= 10 
g= 11
