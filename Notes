I have downlaoded the raspberrypi/linux repo on my computer to look at the linux kernel that runs on the raspi so that I can understand the kernel better.

Now I am working on the encoding part of the project.
After looking at various schemes I am gong to continue with a 3 bit encoding, two encoding bits with a check bit. 
It can only detect and not correct errors, so then the bit will have to be resent.
Some troubles I have ran into is that integers in c are encoded in bytes, and I cannot go from char -> int becuase it does not compress the data as much as id like. 

I am also using geany as a code editor.

After thinking about it for a little bit (haha) I think that I would like to use a 4 bit encoding scheme.
Then I could store two nucleotides as a byte.
Use repetition as a check, not fancy but simple. Also can translate to hex easily

a= 0000 = 0
t= 0101 = 5
c= 1010 = A
g= 1111 = F

 
On second thinking, I will go back to the 2 bit encoding scheme.
Then 4 characters will be translated to one character. 
Then send character at a time to the cpu to align, then send to memory to add to bigger matirix.

----4/2

a= 00 
t= 01 
c= 10 
g= 11 

Need to read up on fwrite with binary files. I would like to make sure that I can get the most out of my compresion.
Right now I believe id be writing a binary file of integers, but need to be better than that.

---4/3
When encoding the nucleotides to binary, we would go as to represent them as hex. A pair of nucleotides could be represented by one hex. Below is the table. Note that they are in order of hex, and that means they are grouped by the second letter in the pair. 

AA=0	AG=4	AC=8	AT=C
GA=1	GG=5	GC=9	GT=D
CA=2	CG=6	CC=A	CT=E
TA=3	TG=7	TC=B	TT=F

With this encoding scheme we are able to have 4 different options for alignment:
single indel, double indel, match, switch.

Right now I am using 15 switch cases for encoding. Looking for a better way to do this.

Now I need to make get rid of the first line in the FASTA file, also make sure that all the nucleotides are in the same case(UPPER)

4/4
Things to talk to professor about:

	Is the attack of encoding the right way to do it.
	Scoring Shema/scoring matrix
	using fwrite to write a binary file, don't wanna use int or hex(ASCII) 
	look at example FASTA files, right now i'm using a test file made by me.2


Notes from Prof:

	look at EmBoss for a comparison of speed
	Do the two schemes get the same score?
	Can it get the best alignment? (compaired to emboss)
	Speed comparisons
	Is paralleled version faster than single CPU?

	Use packing of bits to get the best compression
	look at ASCII character, or look at memory usage

Questions for me to ponder:
	What code will be on the raspi?
	how to run the code on raspi?

	need to do lower level stuff than I am already doing
